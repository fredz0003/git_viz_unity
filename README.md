GitViz is a github commit log visualizer in 3D virtual reality (VR). When we think of 3D our minds may jump to gaming but there is unique and untapped potential in using VR to learn and understand complex systems. GitViz demonstrates this potential. 

Using the Oculus Rift headset and the Unity game engine, users can visualize any git commit log as a series of commits over time that change a repository's structure. 



Oculus Rift app: C# / Unity, JSON.Net

Web app: Python / Flask, HTML, CSS
